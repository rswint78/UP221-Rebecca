# UP221-Rebecca
Hi, I'm Rebecca, and I'm a 1st year MURP. 
I'm excited to learn Python as I've never learned a coding language before. 
I have a BA in Urban Planning from CSUN, and an AS in Business Administration from LAVC. 
For fun, I play roller derby with SFVRD in North Hollywood, along with my two teenage daughters. 
My derby name is Daisy Chainsaw, and my kids are EradiKate and Diana Fire. 


My objectives for this course are to understand how to code, so that I can create visualizations for research projects. I am interested in transit planning and designing equitable public spaces. I want to learn how to overlay data sets onto maps. 

My ideas for the class project consist of investigating traffic collision data to understand if there are causal factors that can be corrected through better planning and urban design. I am also interested in showing the human cost of cars, in that they are one of the leading causes of death, and that there are alternatives available. Our car dependency is also unsustainable for the environment. I would like to help create visual data that makes it easier for the general population to understand the importance of weaning ourselves away from car dependency, particularly in Los Angeles.
