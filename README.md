# UP221-Rebecca
Hi, I'm Rebecca, and I'm a 1st year MURP. 
I'm excited to learn Python as I've never learned a coding language before. 
I have a BA in Urban Planning from CSUN, and an AS in Business Administration from LAVC. 
For fun, I play roller derby with SFVRD in North Hollywood, along with my two teenage daughters. 
My derby name is Daisy Chainsaw, and my kids are EradiKate and Diana Fire.
